Create a cheerful and festive mobile app for New Year celebrations where users can create, send, and receive greetings with friends, family, or the community. Users can design messages with text, images, GIFs, stickers, or voice notes, using templates and festive animations like snow, fireworks, and confetti. AI can suggest creative messages, rhymes, or poems. Users can send greetings directly, anonymously, or post them on a public wall. Fun features like surprise random greetings, interactive countdowns, mini-games, and reward badges make the experience joyful. Users can react to greetings with emojis or animations, collaborate on greeting chains, and form small groups for private exchanges. Themes like traditional, fantasy, kawaii, or sci-fi allow personalization, and messages can be scheduled to arrive at midnight. The interface should feel bright, lively, and festive with smooth animations, easy editing, and celebration-themed notifications. Cloud sync ensures messages and media are saved across devices, with encryption to protect privacy. Future enhancements could include AI-generated video or music greetings and augmented reality messages that overlay in the real world. The app’s unique charm is turning New Year greetings into a magical, interactive, and memorable experience for everyone.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can edit the title and description. Once that file is added, I’ll also create a new file `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` for the app logo.
